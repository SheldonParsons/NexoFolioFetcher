# Capture 3, package 1.4.0

## Transport and compatibility

POST /v1/ingestion/batches accepts schema_version=3 using batch.schema.json and per-record record.schema.json. HTTP payload_version=1 remains compatible with the existing payload. Supported kinds are http_exchange, page_context, interaction, ui_snapshot and image_reference (payload_version=1). This package updates the passive-use and local sampling policy; wire schemas and generated types remain unchanged from 1.3.0.

The public API is producer-neutral. An HTTP-only integration may omit context; it need not invent browser, page, frame or interaction IDs. Producers that do have page evidence may supply it independently. Chrome-specific collection policy is in chrome-sampling-profile.md; it is not a requirement for other producers.

Discover enhanced support with GET /v1/ingestion/capabilities?schema_version=3. Default capability responses preserve the legacy shape. A server advertising only 1/2 does not support enhanced upload: retain new-format records and do not rewrite queued IDs/payloads. V3 response follows receipt.schema.json. accepted means durable receipt, not a new interface; structure separately reports accepted/duplicate/not_applicable. Full retries replay the original receipt; conflicting ID reuse rejects. Historical v1/v2 receipts never change. New legacy HTTP observations feed evidence while their responses retain structural accepted/FORWARDED or ignored/DUPLICATE_CURRENT_STRUCTURE semantics. V3 is required to query independent observation receipts.

Capture scope, actor, producer, project/environment and IDs are immutable once queued. No values or original URLs are redacted. Page bridge input is untrusted; the authenticated integration, not page scripts, owns binding. Retain queued records until matching receipts; offline/storage errors must not silently discard unacknowledged data. Structural duplicates still carry new evidence; a retry must not add support counts.

## Context, timing and associations

Common context IDs are client UUIDs. event_seq is monotonic per frame/view, timing is Unix milliseconds. Enhanced records require context. Allocate record/context IDs before durable enqueue and preserve them through retries. No user-operated recording session is required. Capture is passive during ordinary use: users may interrupt activity A to work on B, revisit A later, or have independent requests in flight. A page lifetime, upload batch, temporal window or dataset is not a business workflow. Neither collection nor downstream analysis may infer shared user intent or causality merely from adjacency, sequence or value equality. Preserve the observed context of each event; unknown associations remain unknown.

captured_at is the observation time, not upload or background-message receipt time. HTTP request_started_at_ms and response_completed_at_ms describe the actual request lifecycle; freeze its owner/context at request start and retain that context through completion, navigation and queue delay. Missing or inconsistent timing is missing evidence, not permission to infer causality.

interaction_id groups evidence for one observed operation when the producer can support that association. It is not proof that the operation caused every request. Do not attach an arbitrarily old operation to unrelated traffic. One operation may have an interaction target and one ui_snapshot containing the relevant controls at that time; HTTP records can share the operation ID without duplicating its snapshot. Page context without an operation ID remains page-level context. Time proximity alone must not create an operation association.

Backend field mapping uses the same project/environment, actor/producer, browser/page/frame/view, operation and valid time order. A snapshot must have been captured at or before the request start (within the bounded 120-second correlation window); delayed upload does not change capture time. Both UI-first and HTTP-first processing are supported. Visible controls are compared with request values; multiple matching fields or indistinguishable controls do not establish a binding. Technical credentials do not establish a value mapping. Numeric/string conversion is explicit in the derived evidence, not a change to the raw values.

Mappings remain inferred candidates with both HTTP and UI source references; they do not establish complete enums or causal truth. Evidence that cannot be mapped remains raw/page-level evidence. A previous control binding cannot establish omission in a different interface or definition revision. Polling without a supported operation association stays unassociated.

UiValue always includes state and value: present can contain null; omitted/unknown carry null. A blank UI option is not proof that an API parameter was omitted. Actual omission requires a prior matching field binding and a complete request. Options may be partial/virtualized: use complete=false plus limitations. Unknown UI state is not API omission.

## Assets and gaps

PUT /v1/projects/{project_id}/assets/{asset_id} uploads original PNG/JPEG/WebP bytes (max 8MiB), Content-Type required; response asset.schema.json. Same project/asset ID and bytes replay; changed content returns 409. Authenticated GET returns original bytes, Cache-Control:no-store and nosniff. Upload assets before their image_reference record; preserve dependencies/retries. Image dimensions are viewport CSS pixels plus device_pixel_ratio. Asset support remains available to existing queues and other producers even when a client does not collect new images. Assets and evidence never cross project ACL boundaries.

Capability/interruption gaps use complete=false and limitations, retaining original context and known values. Do not synthesize network completion or fill unobserved breadcrumbs/regions. Never treat an unread image or inaccessible frame as observed evidence. The server does not call models in capture admission or mechanical evidence extraction.

Examples: fixtures/http-only.json exercises a non-browser producer; fixtures/query-form.json shows a page, status selection, later query operation, frozen form state, associated HTTP and unrelated polling. fixtures/interleaved-use.json captures independent A/B operations on the same page URL, with A completing after B while retaining A's context. Synthetic fixture IDs are examples, not IDs to reuse for live uploads.
